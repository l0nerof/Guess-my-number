# Guess My Number

Guess My Number is a browser-based game where the user must guess a number between 1 and 20. The player has 20 attempts to guess the number, and after each unsuccessful attempt, a hint is displayed whether the hidden number is higher or lower than the guessed number. After the game ends, the best result is recorded, and the game can be restarted immediately. This project was developed to enhance skills in JavaScript, DOM manipulation, HTML, and CSS.
